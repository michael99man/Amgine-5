A encrypted chatroom that implements a RESTful API and leverages both public-key (2048-bit RSA) and private-key (AES-256) encryption to securely transmit and store messages.

This project contains code for my final project done for my Independent Study in Applied Cryptography at The Lawrenceville School under Dr. Keith Voss. This project includes a PHP RESTful server that can be connected to a database, as well as a Java client implementation of an encrypted chatroom. The encryption functions in two stages: first, using a public database of public keys, each chat client generates a new AES-256 secret key to encrypt a message, then encrypts it with 2048-bit RSA. The encrypted secret key, ciphertext, as well as a signed timestamp, are sent to the PHP server with a POST. Each client then pings the server for new messages that it can decrypt.
